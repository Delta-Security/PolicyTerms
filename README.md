## Terms of Service:

By using our services, you agree to the following:

1. We retain the right to refuse service to anyone for any reason, including (but not limited to) reasons related to previous experiences with such customers. With the exception of extreme cases or services related to physical hardware, we will most likely also grant refunds. (We also retain the right to refuse service to anyone pre-sale.)

2. Breaking U.S. federal law under our services will result in immediate termination without refund, along with appropriate legal action being taken against the customer.

3. For VPSes and dedicated servers, you are not to break any part of OVH Limited's terms of service and contracts, found at https://www.ovh.com/world/support/contracts/. Doing so may also result in a refusal of service without refund.

4. For VPSes and dedicated servers under U.S. jurisdiction, you must also follow OVH US LLC's terms of service alongside OVH Limited's terms of service and contracts. OVH US LLC's terms of service can be found at https://us.ovhcloud.com/legal/terms-of-service. If you are subject to term 4, you will be terminated without refund if you so choose to break OVH US LLC's terms of service.

5. When asked for payment, users get two days to either backup their data, or to pay. After those two days, customers who have not paid shall get their server terminated, and data will not be kept, and Delta Security does not have a way of recovering such data.
